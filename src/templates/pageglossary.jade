            dt Alt Coins
            dd The word “altcoin” is an abbreviation of “Bitcoin alternative,” and thus describes every single cryptocurrency except for Bitcoin. Altcoins are referred to as Bitcoin alternatives because, at least to some extent, most altcoins hope to either replace or improve upon at least one Bitcoin component.

          dl
            dt P2P Networks
            dd Commonly abbreviated as P2P networks, are a distributed application architecture in which peers, or nodes, are equally privileged and equal participants in the computing tasks or fulfilling work loads on the network. The tasks and work is distributed evenly, and form a “peer-to-peer network of nodes”.

            dt Wallet
            dd A “wallet” is basically the Bitcoin equivalent of a bank account. It allows you to receive bitcoins, store them, and then send them to others. There are two main types of wallets. A software wallet is one that you install on your own computer or mobile device.

          dl
            dt Asymmetric Encryption
            dd Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses public keys and private keys. Public keys are keys that can be dispersed widely, whereas private keys are keys that are only known to the owner. In this type of cryptographic system, public keys can be used by anyone to encrypt or verify a message for a particular receiver. Private keys are what is used to decrypt or sign a message; only the private key of the receiver can decrypt that message.

          dl
            dt Distributed Ledger
            dd A distributed ledger (also called shared ledger) is a consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. There is no central administrator or centralised data storage.

        li.all.high
          dl
            dt Merkle Tree
            dd Merkle data tries are also known as hash trees or merkle trees. This reference to “trees” comes from a type of data structure that is similar to a tree, with root values and subtrees branching from parent nodes. This, therefore represents a set of linked nodes. Hash trees are useful for verifying any kind of data that is stored, transferred, or handled between computers. Currently, hash trees are mainly used to ensure that blocks that are received from other peers are unaltered and that fake blocks are not sent.

            dt Blocks
            dd Are filled with transactions from the network, and as the transactions are validated, they are compiled into the blockchain permanently.

        li.all.high
          dl
            dt Hash Function
            dd The hash function takes an input of any length (a message, for example), and returns a fixed-length string of numbers and letters, which is the hash value (also known as a message digest, digital fingerprint, or digest). The hash value, or digest, is the digital signature. This means that a person who knows the hash value cannot know the original message, but the person who knows the original message can prove the hash value is created from that message. When digests are equal, it confirms that the message has not been modified or changed since it was signed.

        li.all.high
          dl
            dt Nonce
            dd A nonce is an arbitrary number used in cryptography to ensure uniqueness and prevent the re-running of transactions (known as a replay attack). The value of PoW algorithms is that there is no better strategy to find such a nonce than enumerating all possibilities, however verification of a solution is relatively minor. Since outputs have a uniformly random distribution, it can be guaranteed that, on average, the time needed to find such a nonce is dependant on the difficulty threshold. This makes it possible to control the time of finding a new block simply by adjusting the difficulty.

            dt Double Spending
            dd A double spend is an attack where the given set of coins is spent in more than one transaction. There are a couple main ways to perform a double spend: Send two conflicting transactions in rapid succession into the Bitcoin network. This is called a race attack

          dl
            dt Gas
            dd is the resource cost of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Gas and Ether are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. Ether is used to pay for gas, and from there, system computations; but Ether is not gas. In order for transactions to be sent and executed on, the sender must pay a fee in units of gas. Each transactions fee depends on the operations, and therefore resources, required to compute the transaction.

          dl
            dt Ethereum
            dd Ethereum is a public blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM),

        li.all.middle
          dl
            dt Ether (token)
            dd Ether is used within the platform to execute peer-to-peer transactions and contracts. Ether is the currency used within Ethereum to pay for resource consumption on the network. This is done indirectly through exchanging Ether for “gas”, which will be explained in-depth in the next section. For shorthand, Ether is often abbreviated as ETH. Ether is a unique cryptocurrency because it is also used as a form of “cryptofuel” for the Ethereum EVM, in the sense that it is used to pay for computations done within the EVM.

        li.all.low
          dl
            dt Cryptography
            dd The use of mathematics to create codes and ciphers that can be used to conceal information. Used as the basis for the mathematical problems used to verify and secure transactions on the blockchain.

        li.all.middle
          dl
            dt Receipt
            dd Every transaction is time stamped and given a hash tx

        li.all.low
          dl
            dt Smart contracts
            dd Smart contracts also known as a smart property are computer protocols that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary. Smart contracts often emulate the logic of contractual clauses.

        li.all.middle
          dl
            dt EVM
            dd The Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, is the protocol that handles the computational aspects and internal state of the blockchain. This can be considered the “decentralized computer” that is able to maintain the internal database and enables the execution of code. Every operation that is executed in the EVM is simultaneously executed on every single node.

        li.all.middle
          dl
            dt PoW (Proof of Work)
            dd A system that ties mining capability to computational power. Blocks must be hashed, which is in itself an easy computational process, but an additional variable is added to the hashing process to make it more difficult. When a block is successfully hashed, the hashing must have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered proof of work.

        li.all.high
          dl
            dt PoS (Proof of Stake)
            dd An alternative to proof of work, in which your existing stake in a currency (the amount of that currency that you hold) is used to calculate the amount of that currency that you can mine. “Virtualized” mining

        li.all.low
          dl
            dt Scalability
            dd The capacity to be changed in size or scale to handle ongoing demand for blockchain network resources.

        li.all.middle
          dl
            dt Light Client
            dd Light client is a protocol that allows users with lower capacities than full nodes to maintain high security assurance about a state in the network or verify transactions. Full security is only possible for full nodes, but by implementing light client's, smaller amounts of data can be processed and verified that are of importance to the user, therefore leaving contracts of imperative security and trust to full nodes.

        li.all.middle
          dl
            dt Sharding
            dd Sharding will allow for parallel processing such that not all nodes need to validate each transaction. The goal is to implement the EVM as a replicated distributed virtual machine.

        li.all.low
          dl
            dt Mining
            dd Through mining, the users secure the network and verify computation. In the current systems, including Bitcoin’s blockchain, miners are incentivized to validate transactions based of off Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol, fees, and protocol subsidies. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is the upcoming, virtualized system of incentivization for validating transactions. Both of these systems provide economic guarantees and a form of consensus by bet, but Proof-of-Stake relies on the betting concept more so.

        li.all.low
          dl
            dt Nodes
            dd Child nodes point to parent nodes, so nodes further “up the tree” are hashes of their respective children. Most hash trees implementations are binary, with each node under two child nodes, although more than two child nodes can be used under each node.

        li.all.middle
          dl
            dt DAO
            dd An organization that runs autonomously, in a decentralized manner, that functions without the need for centralized parties to make decisions for the organization to grow, to be profitable, or *physically* exist.
